{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://www.violetlingenfelter.com/india-2019/\">See the website here</a></p>\n<p>From May 10, 2019 to June 13, 2019, I participated in a Dialogue of Civilizations on Climate Change Science and Policy in India and Nepal. A Dialogue of Civilizations is a faculty-led summer program where students travel and take two courses. See more about Northeastern University Dialogue of Civilizations <a href=\"https://www.northeastern.edu/geo/dialogue/\">here</a>. Our dialogue was led by <a href=\"https://www.civ.neu.edu/people/ganguly-auroop\">Auroop Ganguly</a> and <a href=\"https://wwww.linkedin.com/in/katemduffy\">Kate Duffy</a>, one of his PhD students. We started our journey in Kolkata, and ended in Kovalam. Over the course of the trip we stayed in 8 cities in both Nepal and India. </p>\n<p>For my final project, I decided to make a photography portfolio website. I used this as an opportunity to try out TypeScript, and use Gatsby.js as my framework. The website features a minimalist design, with seperate photo pages for each city we stayed in. I also included a reflection on our trip and the program. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dialogue of Civilizations Final Project","date":"June 21, 2019","author":"Violet Lingenfelter","tags":["TypeScript","Gatsby.js","photography"],"cover":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/projects/crow-map/about/"}}
