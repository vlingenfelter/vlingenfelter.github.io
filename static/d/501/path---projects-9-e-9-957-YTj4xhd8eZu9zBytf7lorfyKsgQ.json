We started our journey in Kolkata, and ended in Kovalam. Over the course of the trip we stayed in 8 cities in both Nepal and India. </p>\n<p>For my final project, I decided to make a photography portfolio website. I used this as an opportunity to try out TypeScript, and use Gatsby.js as my framework. The website features a minimalist design, with seperate photo pages for each city we stayed in. I also included a reflection on our trip and the program. </p>"}},{"node":{"children":[],"id":"c95d8116-e367-5afe-b2d8-a727b2d3dbdc","frontmatter":{"title":"Bus Crowding: Ridgeline Plot","date":"April

On the most basic level, bus crowding is defined by the <a href=\"https://www.mbta.com/policies\">MBTA Service Delivery Policy</a> as a function of vehicle occupancy in terms of passenger time. This means that the actual measurment of crowding is in uncomfortable passenger hours, meaning the cummulative time spent by passengers in uncomfortable conditions  During high occupancy times, all passengers are considered uncomfortable if a vehicle is at 140% of its seated capacity (meaning that for every 3 people sitting, another person is standing). When the vehicle is between 125% and 140% seated capacity, all standing passengers are considered uncomfortable and their time is counted for the metric. For times that aren't high occupancy, if the vehicle is at 125% of seated capacity or higher, all passengers are considered uncomfortable. Otherwise all passengers are considered comfortable. </p>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a05c3963d7dab57501c090655c8daf77/tumblr_prqqrzhl9I1scy1sco2_1280.png\" alt=\"Outbound crowding on route 111\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>Outbound crowding on route 111 shows intense crowding starting around 3 p.m. at the beginning of the route. By looking at the streamgraph, we can see crowding on this route is caused mostly by bunching and transfers (shown in light purple).</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Why crowding matters</h2>\n<p>Reducing trips made by single occupancy vehicles is key to reducing emissions in the US. The sector that contributed most to US greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 was the transportation sector, contributing almost 30% of greenhouse gas emissions. A key way to cut down on these emissions is for single occupancy vehicle trips to be made on ‘cleaner’ modes of transport — like public transportation, walking, or biking. Cities that wish to reduce their emissions therefore must look to making improvements in public transit in order to cut down on single occupancy vehicle trips. </p>\n<p>Getting individuals to make the switch from private single occupancy vehicle transportation to public transportation requires users to find the mode switch to be, among other factors, a convenience. When considering a mode shift, comfort is one of the many factors that a potential rider will consider. Perceived comfort can be linked to dissatisfaction with standing and not being seated, with lessened ability to make use of time during a public transit trip (i.e. reading a book), and the physical closeness to other travellers. As passenger comfort is an inherently subjective metric with wide variation, it can be difficult for transit authorities to measure and improve. Factors that contribute to perceived comfort can be linked to crowding, which can be easier for agencies to measure. Crowding is also a good metric to identify demand in certain areas at certain times; if a bus along a particular route is crowded, that means that the origin destination pair that route serves is in high demand during the time segments where it is chronically crowded. </p>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/123078a259b56f2804b014605d7a7909/tumblr_prqqrzhl9I1scy1sco3_1280.png\" alt=\"Inbound crowding on route 111\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>Inbound crowding on route 111 shows intense crowding throughout most of the morning at the end of the route. By looking at the streamgraph, we can see a spike in crowding caused by insufficient planned frequency (in red) around 7 a.m..</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Crowding must be a consideration when transit authorities seek to gain ridership, or when metropolitan areas seek to reduce emissions because crowding not only points to where passengers are less comfortable, but also to where the system is in high demand. Crowding metrics can show planners whether a system, under its current operating schedule, can handle an increase in passenger load. If the system, at peak demand times, is already at maximum capacity, then the vehicles within the system cannot handle an increase in passengers. Simply put, a crowded system cannot handle any new passengers without making changes to the operations. If metropolitan areas choose to make policy to incentivize mode shift from single occupancy vehicles, they must make sure to adequately provide for improvements in public transit systems to prevent overcrowding. This includes addressing crowding in vehicles and making sure agencies have the capacity to take an increase in ridership. </p>\n<p>In addition to attracting potential riders, improvements in passenger comfort benefit current riders. Reductions in crowding have been shown to be more beneficial for commuter perception than increases in reliability. Crowding in public transit has been shown to increase stress levels of riders. Crowding conditions affect riders’ ability to choose optimal work times, their ability to be productive during their trip, and the cost they associate with their journey. </p>\n<h5>Special thanks to:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arthur Prokosch</strong>, project management and support</li>\n<li><strong>Laura Riegel</strong>, opinion-giver and transit data expert</li>\n</ul>"}},{"node":{"children":[],"id":"17f3127e-688f-5753-b24a-77ece8f7af91","frontmatter":{"title":"Independent GIS Project","date":"April 27, 2019","tags":["PostGIS","Python","311 Data"],"blurb":"As part of my GIS coursework, I analyzed whether public restrooms installed in the city of San Francisco actually had an effect on occurrences of human feces on the streets.","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","tracedSVG":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='400' height='289'%3e%3cpath d='M280 128v161h120V0H280v128' fill='%23d3d3d3' fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e","aspectRatio":1.3836477987421383,"src":"/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/83a6c/heatmapp.png","srcSet":"/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/a4c64/heatmapp.png 190w,\n/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/d9bfb/heatmapp.png 380w,\n/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/83a6c/heatmapp.png 440w","srcWebp":"/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/485cb/heatmapp.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/18aa5/heatmapp.webp 190w,\n/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/ba249/heatmapp.webp 380w,\n/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/485cb/heatmapp.webp 440w","sizes":"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px","originalImg":"/static/7855e4da242107fa690ca399e01f9c79/83a6c/heatmapp.png","originalName":"heatmapp.png","presentationWidth":440,"presentationHeight":318}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/projects/gis/about/"},"excerpt":"In 2014, the city of San Francisco, through its Department of Public Works, launched an initiative to cut down on human feces complaints in the city.

This program is a network of public restrooms that are maintained by the department of public works, and contain safe needle disposal sights, restroom facilities, and pet waste disposal sites. The program, the Pitstop Program, has been lauded as a success, but still, media coverage of the human waste in San Francisco has increased, indicating that general discontent with street cleanliness has increased as well. Human waste on the streets presents a health hazard, as well as general discomfort. At the very least, cleaning this waste is a drain on limited city resources, so programs like the Pitstop program are essential to intercept this waste before it ends up on the streets.</p>\n<p>This analysis seeks to determine whether there are certain factors that predispose an area to having more 311 cases regarding human feces. By finding what predisposes a neighborhood to this problem, I hope to determine possible methods of intervention so that feces can be diverted away from the city streets and into a toilet. This analysis will focus on the most recent year of full data, 2018. I will look at data from the census, from other 311 incidents, human waste incidents from prior years, and 911 calls to see if any of these factors predispose a neighborhood to high human waste case volumes.</p>\n<p>This analysis will look at both when and where cases about human feces occur to see if the hours of operation and the locations of the Pitstops are effective.

More than 7,000 people self-reported experiencing homelessness in in 2017, which is slightly less than 1% of the city population. This means that 1 out of every 100 people in San Francisco experienced homelessness during the year. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Of that population, 58% reported being unsheltered (Applied Survey Research, 2017). In the 2015-2016 fiscal year, the city spent more than $241 million on homeless services (Knight and Fagan, 2016).</p>\n<p>The Pitstop Program is an initiative by the San Francisco Department of Public Works which aims to provide safe and clean toilet, safe needle drop off locations, and pet waste disposal in areas that are of outstanding need in the city. The program features park restrooms, portable toilets, and JCDecaux self cleaning public toilet facilities. JCDecaux facilities also double as advertising billboards. The facilities kept by the program are “maintained to a standard where parents and guardians would feel comfortable bringing their children” , and are not open at night. Collectively, the restrooms are open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. An explicitly stated result of the program is that “complaints about human waste in public spaces around the Pit Stop locations have gone down” (Department of Public Works). This can be checked by analyzing the 311 reports of human waste in the city before and after the program was implemented.  </p>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2abd2561a974f3a78e0e28ff145a93d/tumblr_pr3ks4Hy3v1scy1sco6_1280.png\" alt=\"A heatmap showing an increase in total number of calls each year\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>We can see that there has been a clear increase in the total number of calls recieved by the city of San Francisco's 311 department since 2009, and that there does not seem to be any months were there are consistently more calls. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The City of San Francisco makes all 311 reports public. These calls include calls regarding human waste that must be cleaned up. When the Department of Public Works cleans human waste, they power wash the sidewalk where the incident occured. This means that the odor and the appearance of the waste is eliminated, but the process vaporizes the feces and makes it airborne. I have heard anecdotal evidence from some of those experiencing homelessness in the city that the ingestion of airborne feces has caused many of the homeless population in the city to suffer from digestive illness, such as the shigellosis caused by the shigella bacteria. Shigellosis is contracted from contact with feces, and the main sign of infection is diarrhea (Mayo Clinic, 2019).  It follows logically that cleaning feces in this manor is dangerous and can potentially lead to more feces, and therefore the best strategy for combating human waste in the streets is prevention.</p>\n<p>The Pitstop program is an intervention program designed to mitigate human waste in the streets, therefore saving DPW man hours, and potentially preventing public health problems. Analyzing the effectiveness of the program will help to inform future policy action and potential extension of the program.</p>\n<!-- \n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ad947926477bbc631d480e62ac882d8/tumblr_pr3ks4Hy3v1scy1sco9_540.png\" alt=\"San francisco with points of human waste calls imposed over it\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>The inspiration for the Joy Division album cover actually came from a data visualization from the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Astronomy</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div> -->\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Data for where human feces is occurring and where encampments are was taken from 311 data published by the city of San Francisco. Demographic information was taken from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. 911 call volume was approximated by 911 call volume that was directed to SFFD (San Francisco Fire Department) and was obtained from the city of San Francisco. The locations of the restrooms in the Pitstop program were also taken from the San Francisco Open Data Portal.</p>\n<p>All call data (both 311 and 911) was subsetted so that only calls that had locations attributed to them were included in the analysis. Approximately 10% of 311 calls did not have correct locational attributes or any locational attributes at all (where “correct” locational attributes are ones that fall within the boundaries of San Francisco). This is a large enough loss that it is worth noting.</p>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/386dd9e1da18d884f27b71a454cd5656/tumblr_pr3ks4Hy3v1scy1sco1_1280.png\" alt=\"San francisco with points of human waste calls imposed over it\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>This map shows the result of clustering analysis with the pit stop locations shown in yellow. Blocks that are blue show clusters of low human waster related call volume, whereas red blocks show clusters of high call volumes. Pink and light blue denote outliers, where pink shows an unusually high cluster near low clusters and light blue shows an unusually low cluster near high clusters. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>I created a spatial weights matrix using queen contiguity and calculated spatial lag for human waste reports in 2018. I then tested for spatial autocorrelation with Moran’s I, finding I=0.62437 with P=0.001. This indicated global spatial autocorrelation. To look for local autocorrelation, I calculated LISAs. I ran OLS spatial diagnostics to confirm this Moran’s I value and ran both Lagrange multiplier test for spatial lag model as well as Lagrange multiplier test for spatial error model, and both were significant so I chose to create a generalized method of moments model to explain human waste calls.</p>\n<p>In my regression, I included demographic information as to the percentage of population that identifies as white, the total number of vacant units, the total number of 911 calls to the fire department, the total number of 311 calls, the total number of calls regarding encampments, and the population density, all from 2018, which is the last full year of data for both 311 calls and 911 calls, and all aggregated to the census block level. I also chose to include the number of calls in each block regarding human waste from 2013, which was the year before the Pitstop program was implemented and presumably the year of data that the Pitstop locations were based upon.</p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>This analysis shows that there are strong temporal trends across any given day and strong spatial autocorrelation for human feces complaints. This means that people are more likely to report human waste clean up sites during between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the Tenderloin and the SoMa neighborhoods. There are many possible explanations for these trends, some of which I will discuss in this section.</p>\n<p>Temporal analysis using 311 calls is difficult considering the time associated with each datum is when someone reported seeing human feces, not when the production of said feces occured. At night, when the Pitstop locations are closed, people who would be reporting human waste incidents are at home. This means that when people are commuting to work and active in the morning, they see waste that accumulated overnight when the restrooms were unavailable, and call to report this accumulated waste. This is one possible explanation of the spike in call volume we see in Figures 3 and 4, and could be tested by extending Pitstop hours into the night, ideally so that some located at the centers of hotspots are open 24/7, and seeing what effect this policy change has on call volume. Given this explanation, I recommend that the Department of Public Works extend the hours of the existing Pitstop locations or open more locations in the neighborhoods where there are feces hot spots.</p>\n<!-- <div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ad947926477bbc631d480e62ac882d8/tumblr_pr3ks4Hy3v1scy1sco9_540.png\" alt=\"San francisco with points of human waste calls imposed over it\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>The inspiration for the Joy Division album cover actually came from a data visualization from the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Astronomy</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div> -->\n<p>Additionally, deploying additional programs or giving more funding to existing programs that serve to combat homelessness could be an effective way of remove human waste from the streets of San Francisco. Most people, when afforded the opportunity, will chose to use a restroom over relieving themselves outdoors. The most obvious solution to a human waste problem is to ensure that all people have access to restrooms at all times, be it through an extensive public restroom network, or through private restrooms. Giving additional resources to effective programs designated to transition those living outdoors to living indoors could be another way to mitigate human feces on the street.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I would have included data for 911 calls directed to police department precincts as well as 911 calls directed to the fire department. The city of San Francisco releases 911 call data, but it is not georeferenced and the address associated with each call were not such that I could geocode them. I decided to leave this dataset out of my analysis because I could not aggregate that data to the block level. Future analysis may be done using police districts as the unit of analysis to allow for 911 data from the SFPD to be included.</p>\n<!-- <div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ad947926477bbc631d480e62ac882d8/tumblr_pr3ks4Hy3v1scy1sco9_540.png\" alt=\"San francisco with points of human waste calls imposed over it\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p>The inspiration for the Joy Division album cover actually came from a data visualization from the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Astronomy</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div> -->\n<p>Future analysis of human waste should include a time series analysis to see how the clusters of human waste calls are moving on a more granular time scale and spatial unit to determine whether fixed restroom locations are ideal to combat waste issues. Sociological research with those experiencing homelessness to see if they find the Pitstop program to be effective should also be conducted. It may also be worthwhile to survey San Francisco residents to see which demographics participate in 311 and where they live. It may be useful to see if some demographics or residents of some neighborhoods are more likely to participate in 311 reporting, and to consider that when looking at where to implement more Pitstops.  </p>\n<p>Additional analysis of the Pitstop program’s effectiveness may also include 311 calls regarding needles found on the street. The Pitstop program includes safe needle disposal sites, so it would be interesting to see if the implementation of the program coincides with changes in call patterns about needle disposal. The Department of Public Works did not make specific claims about removing needles from the street, so I chose not to look at that data in this analysis. It may also be worthwhile to look at public health data, such as cases of shigella or E. Coli to see if variation in occurances of these bacteria is related to where there are high incidents of human waste on the streets.</p>"}},{"node":{"children":[],"id":"9443ac76-e78e-550d-80d3-21c1ccfcc9b6","frontmatter":{"title":"S.

SLIDE is a prioritization tool designed to rank bus stops in the MBTA’s network in order of how \"deserving\" they are of new stop amenities. Stop amenities are things that generally improve a riders experience, like a shelter or a bench. SLIDE allows policymakers to systematically compare all bus stops in the network when emphasis is given to different criteria.</p>\n<p>SLIDE is a tool that quickly visualizes where to invest in new bus stop infrastructure based on what the user decides is important. SLIDE allows the user to emphasize the weight of the vulnerability of riders, the amount of people who begin their journeys at a stop, and the amount of people who transfer at a stop.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>SLIDE takes whatever subset of stops the user chooses, and how the user weighted vulnerable populations, origin ridership, and transfer ridership, and generates a ranked list using these criteria. SLIDE then displays this on a web map and stores this ranked list in a csv for download.</p>\n<h3>Why would someone choose a subset of stops?</h3>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a6e56d6ea4181eda803cb8c285048f0/tumblr_plo3ciZJ8a1scy1sco1_640.png\" alt=\"Anatomy of a trip: Origin, Transfer, Destination\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p> Step 1 allows for general categories to be turned on and off or filtered\n  </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Street level infrastructure is typically associated with buses, but buses are not the only mode that can benefit from street level infrastructure. The MBTA has surface level light rail (the Green Line and the Mattapan Trolley) that require riders to wait outdoors. These surface level light rail stops might be considered for new infrastructure due to their high ridership.</p>\n<p>The MBTA also has different classes of buses. The MBTA has a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line called the Silver Line. Because the Silver Line is considered rapid transit, it already has different stop amenities than typical bus stops. Silver Line riders also expect a shorter wait time, given that the line is BRT. The Silver Line stops might be considered for new infrastructure given their high ridership, as well.</p>\n<p>Even within normal bus routes, there are different classifications. Bus routes can either be considered \"Key\" or \"Non-Key\". Key bus routes are more popular routes. Because the ridership on these routes is high and consistent, the MBTA will schedule buses frequently along these routes. Non-key bus routes, or infrequent bus routes, are less traveled. Non-key buses are scheduled less often, and the MBTA expects fewer riders along these routes. Because riders interact differently with the different types of bus routes, users might want to consider them separately for analysis.</p>\n<h3>What are the weights?</h3>\n<p>The different qualities that the user can weight are origin ridership, transfer ridership, and vulnerable populations. Origin ridership indicates how many people start their journeys at a particular stop. Transfer ridership indicates how many people transfer at a given stop, which is a proxy for estimating how long people are waiting at a given stop.</p>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01800ffe9e2feac116427d36ce3cf2a9/tumblr_plo1ucJxST1scy1sco2_1280.png\" alt=\"Anatomy of a trip: Origin, Transfer, Destination\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p> An infographic I designed for SLIDE's info section\n  </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Vulnerable populations serviced by a stop is a more complicated metric. To get estimates on this, we looked at where people with senior discounts and TAP discounts are frequently getting on the bus. Because individuals in these groups tend to have mobility impairments that would prevent them from walking to another bus stop nearby with better amenities, these individuals are prioritized.</p>\n<p>We also used census data to look at neighborhood demographics around each stop, including the amount of income households earn, the racial demographics, and the amount of households without vehicles in surrounding census tracts. Bus stops with amenities are a neighborhood asset, and when investing in new infrastructure the MBTA has the opportunity to invest in historically underserved communities, like those that are majority of people of color. The MBTA also has an obligation to serve those who are typically transit dependent, low income households and households without vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Then what?</h3>\n<div class=\"polariod-container\">\n<div class=\"polaroid\">\n  <img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0414a52859eb8e1317298e6197862319/tumblr_plo3x8H8501scy1sco1_1280.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of one possible SLIDE output\" />\n  <div class=\"container\">\n  <p> A simple graduated symbol and graduated color map show where the high priority bus stops are located. More data, like the adjusted score for each of the weights, is available in the csv.\n  </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The tool is remarkably fast. This allows for stakeholders to play with the data and see how their small decisions dramatically impact where infrastructure gets placed. This tool makes data driven decisions easier, and lets non-technical audiences interact with complex data in a way that is fun and intuitive.</p>\n<h5>Special thanks to:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brittany Meece</strong>, project management</li>\n<li><strong>Anna Sangree</strong>, data preparation (which is no small feat)</li>\n<li><strong>Anna Gartsman</strong>, statistical support, project management</li>\n</ul>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}
